cvsu v.0.1.0

Library of computer vision algorithms for scene understanding.

This library contains research-grade code for analyzing images, and it is under
constant development. It may be useful for others, but no guarantees are given.
Versions in the master branch will hopefully be usable most of the time, the
dev branch contains more experimental features. The interface should remain
constant during each minor release (*.x.*), each new minor release should only
add new interfaces, while major releases may also remove them.

The most up-to-date version will be kept in repository
git@github.com:amnipar/cvsu.git
