{"name":"CVSU","tagline":"Computer Vision for Scene Understanding","body":"### Computer Vision for Scene Understanding\r\n\r\nCVSU is a Computer Vision library for Scene Understanding. I am developing it as part of my doctoral thesis project, and the goal is to offer easy to use, high-level functionality for extracting structured information about visual scenes. This process can be seen as *image parsing*.\r\n\r\nPlanned features:\r\n\r\n* Fast and robust region and boundary extraction\r\n* Geometric representation of scene structure\r\n* Motion tracking with stationary camera, path and shape extraction\r\n* Scene and camera tracking with moving camera\r\n\r\nSome features for segmentation and motion tracking are working already, and in near future a new release will introduce first features for geometric analysis. The library is written in C, with Haskell bindings, and it can work on many platforms, including Android phones.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
